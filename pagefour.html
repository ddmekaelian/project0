  <p class="subheader">Reproduction</p>
  <p class="small w-700">The process of mating between is very interesting. On dry land, and usually between May & September, the female and male crab initially start fighting until the male crab turns the female on his back. Hatching usually takes place between October and November, and the female crab releases her eggs into the ocean. They are in the ocean for about 28 days (a lot of the eggs are eaten by other animals) and once hatched they live as hermit crabs at the bottom of the ocean, or on the shore. The hermit grows and changes its shell and develop a hardened abdomen â€“ then 4 - 8 years later the Coconut Crab can reproduce once again. To note: they are in the hermit crab family. </p>

<div id="section2">
<div class="container-fluid bg-lightblue py-5 px-4">
    <p class="subheader">Sense of smell</p>
  <p class="small">The Coconut Crab has a very strong sense of smell. They have special organs in their antennae that helps locate the location of the smell. Most of these crabs live in water, but the crabs that live on land have shorter organs on their antennae that resemble ones that insects have- they flick them sense anything long distance. Foods like coconuts, bananas, or rotting meat is what attracts their attention the most. </p>
</div></div>
<div id="section3">
<div class="container-fluid bg-white py-5 px-4">
    <p class="subheader">Lifecycle</p>
  <p class="small">These crabs mate only on land - males deposit a large amount of their spermatophores in the females abdomen, and from there they fertilise. Once the female lays the eggs, she glues them to her abdomen for a few months. Once they are ready to hatch, she releases them into the ocean. As mentioned before, once they develop into Hermit Crabs & change their shells, they develop a hardened abdomen and reached sexual maturing after about 5 years. They reach their maximum size after about 40-50 years!</p>
